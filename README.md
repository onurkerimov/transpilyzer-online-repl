# Doja Online Playground

This is the online playground for [Doja](https://github.com/xoidlabs/doja), the first *headless framework* ever that lets you write components **ONCE**, then turn them into real **Vue** or **React** components.

> Doja is still in active development and open for contributions.

### Usage

Development: `yarn && yarn dev`
Production build: `yarn build`
